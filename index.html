    <h1>The Cheese of Truth</h1>

    <h2>History of the Cheese of Truth</h2>

    <p>
        &#x1F9C0; The Cheese of Truth was something that does not has a specific starting date. Trying to find the starting date and year
        of when the cheese of truth first came into this world is hard to pinpoint. I personally remember it becoming bigger during 
        when Vine (which died on Jan. 18th, 2017) was around but that may vary to others. If you browse online you will find yourself
        many videos that show perfect examples of how it works or simply read below! Or maybe you know already then please just enjoy!
    </p>

    <h2>How it works:</h2>

    <p>
        &#x1F9C0; Above you will find 6 different buttons with 6 different names of different swiss cheese's. Clicking the 
        name of the cheese was supposed to give you that cheese but that's sadly impossible. However, by clicking one of the 
        buttons you will get 1 of 6 different randomized cheese's to determine your fortune. After you are on the next page,
        Click the button at the top to generate your text of truth!
    </p>

    <p>
        &#x1F9C0; To use the Cheese of Truth, simply read each of the words shown through the holes of the cheese. Take all 
        the words visible through these holes and string together a few words, sentence or phrase for your truth! (They will not always be in order so you
        may have to decipher it yourself.)
    </p>

    <h2>Example:</h2>

    <div id="lol">
    <img src="https://c.tenor.com/KaQXKLleD7UAAAAd/cheese-of.gif" alt="this slowpoke moves"/>
    </div>

    <p> &#x1F9C0; &#x1F9C0; NOTE: THIS IS NOT AT ALL WHAT YOURS WILL SAY, THIS IS THE ONLY GIF I COULD POSSIBLY FIND THAT WASN'T AN MP4. &#x1F9C0; &#x1F9C0;</p>
